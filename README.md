## Acknowledgements

This project builds upon the [Perceiver PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/perceiver-pytorch) by [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains). We extend the model to address challenges in dynamic/continual learning environments, focusing on mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our modifications are detailed in [section XYZ]. We are grateful to the original authors for their foundational work which made this project possible.
